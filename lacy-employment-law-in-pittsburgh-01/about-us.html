<h2>THE LACY EMPLOYMENT LAW FIRM WAS FOUNDED UPON THREE CONCEPTS.</h2>

<section data-element_type="section" data-id="55304735">
<h3>High Quality Legal Services</h3>

<p>Every person should have the same level of representation that corporations receive. Companies hire lawyers that graduated from the best law schools and who work(ed) at the largest law firms. Shouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

<h3>We Leverage Technology</h3>

<p>We leverage the latest technology to remain efficient. The Lacy Employment Law Firm is almost completely virtual. We keep our clients informed through Google portals. We are a completely paperless office.<br />
<br />
We are a law office of the 21st century.</p>

<h3>We Overinform</h3>

<p>Our goal is to overinform. We will inform you every step of the way of what&rsquo;s going to happen in your case. We aim to answer questions before you ask them. Take a look at our practice area guides and find out.</p>

<h4>A NOTE FROM FOUNDING ATTORNEY</h4>

<h2>Andrew Lacy, Jr., Esq.</h2>

<p>Founding Attorney Andrew Lacy, Jr. Esq. created The Lacy Employment Law Firm to serve people, not corporations.</p>

<p>He promised himself in law school that he would use what he learned to help people.</p>

<p>The skills he learned while working at a large international law firm (&ldquo;Biglaw&rdquo;), help him do just that.</p>

<h3><em>His accomplishments:</em></h3>
</section>

<section data-element_type="section" data-id="e202a5f">
<ul>
	<li>He<strong> won his first jury trial</strong> at 26 years-old in a <strong>federal civil rights</strong> case. He was amongst the youngest lawyers in the country to accomplish such a feat.</li>
	<li>He has <strong>tried multiple cases to verdict in federal court</strong>. Many <a href="https://employment-labor-law.com/employment-lawyers-in-pittsburgh-pa/">employment lawyers</a> never see a jury trial.</li>
	<li>He <strong>clerked for the Honorable Cathy Bissoon, a federal judge</strong> in Pittsburgh. Federal judges only hire graduates from top law schools or those at the very top of their law school class.</li>
</ul>

<p>.<br />
Attorney Lacy is a graduate of Cornell Law School. There, he was on the Dean&rsquo;s List his first semester, an honor given to the top 30% of the class.</p>

<p>He also served as the academic advisor in the Black Law Student Association (BLSA). Other activities included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Participating in <strong>Cornell&rsquo;s Labor Law Clinic</strong>.</li>
	<li>Teaching business law in Cornell&rsquo;s Prison Education Program.</li>
	<li>Competing as a member of <strong>Cornell&rsquo;s mock trial team</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>.<br />
<em>He graduated from Washington and Jefferson College, cum laude, with his degree in Political Science.</em></p>

<p>In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his loving and supportive wife, Tara. Tara is also a lawyer, graduating from Cornell. The two constantly compete over who is the best lawyer in the family. That is the only case that Attorney Lacy remains doubtful that he can win.</p>
