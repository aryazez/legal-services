<h2>THE LACY EMPLOYMENT LAW FIRM WAS FOUNDED UPON THREE CONCEPTS.</h2>

<section data-element_type="section" data-id="55304735">
<h3>High Quality Legal Services</h3>

<h3>We Leverage Technology</h3>

<p>We leverage the latest technology to remain efficient. The Lacy Employment Law Firm is almost completely virtual. We keep our clients informed through Google portals. We are a completely paperless office.<br />
<br />
We are a law office of the 21st century.</p>

<h3>We Overinform</h3>

<p>Our goal is to overinform. We will inform you every step of the way of what&rsquo;s going to happen in your case. We aim to answer questions before you ask them. Take a look at our practice area guides and find out.</p>

<h4>A NOTE FROM FOUNDING ATTORNEY</h4>

<h2>Andrew Lacy, Jr., Esq.</h2>

<p>Founding Attorney Andrew Lacy, Jr. Esq. created The Lacy Employment Law Firm to serve people, not corporations.</p>

<p>He promised himself in law school that he would use what he learned to help people.</p>

<p>The skills he learned while working at a large international law firm (&ldquo;Biglaw&rdquo;), help him do just that.</p>

<h3><em>His accomplishments:</em></h3>
</section>

<section data-element_type="section" data-id="e202a5f">
<ul>
	<li>He<strong> won his first jury trial</strong> at 26 years-old in a <strong>federal civil rights</strong> case. He was amongst the youngest lawyers in the country to accomplish such a feat.</li>
	<li>He has <strong>tried multiple cases to verdict in federal court</strong>. Many <a href="https://employment-labor-law.com/employment-lawyers-in-pittsburgh-pa/">employment lawyers</a> never see a jury trial.</li>
	<li>He <strong>clerked for the Honorable Cathy Bissoon, a federal judge</strong> in Pittsburgh. Federal judges only hire graduates from top law schools or those at the very top of their law school class.</li>
</ul>

<p>.<br />
Attorney Lacy is a graduate of Cornell Law School. There, he was on the Dean&rsquo;s List his first semester, an honor given to the top 30% of the class.</p>

<p>He also served as the academic advisor in the Black Law Student Association (BLSA). Other activities included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Participating in <strong>Cornell&rsquo;s Labor Law Clinic</strong>.</li>
	<li>Teaching business law in Cornell&rsquo;s Prison Education Program.</li>
	<li>Competing as a member of <strong>Cornell&rsquo;s mock trial team</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>.<br />
<em>He graduated from Washington and Jefferson College, cum laude, with his degree in Political Science.</em></p>

<p>In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his loving and supportive wife, Tara. Tara is also a lawyer, graduating from Cornell. The two constantly compete over who is the best lawyer in the family. That is the only case that Attorney Lacy remains doubtful that he can win.</p>
