<h4>Civil rights lawyer Pittsburgh</h4>
<p class="mb-0"><p></p>

<p>Pittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_River">Allegheny River</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monongahela_River">Monongahela River</a>, which combine to form the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River">Ohio River</a>. It developed as a vital link of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states">Atlantic coast</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-west#European_exploration_and_early_settlement">Midwest</a>, as the mineral-rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a> led to the region being contested by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_colonial_empire">French</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British</a> empires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia">Virginians</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion">Whiskey Rebels</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_in_the_American_Civil_War">Civil War raiders</a>. Pittsburgh is known both as &quot;the Steel City&quot; for its dominant role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_iron_and_steel_industry_in_the_United_States">history of the U.S. steel industry</a>, and as the &quot;City of Bridges&quot; for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bridges_of_Pittsburgh">446 bridges</a>. For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York City</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago">Chicago</a> in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. Starting in the post-war era, Pittsburgh leaders began to strategically divest in manufacturing and invest instead in education, science, technology, health care, and art. This led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindustrialization_by_country#United_States">Deindustrialization</a> in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in massive layoffs among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker">blue-collar workers</a> as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Pittsburgh">downtown</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker">white-collar workers</a> also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.</p>
