It developed as a vital link of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_states">Atlantic coast</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-west#European_exploration_and_early_settlement">Midwest</a>, as the mineral-rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a> led to the region being contested by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_colonial_empire">French</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire">British</a> empires, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia">Virginians</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion">Whiskey Rebels</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_in_the_American_Civil_War">Civil War raiders</a>.
